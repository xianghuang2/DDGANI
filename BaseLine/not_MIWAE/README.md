not-MIWAE: Deep generative modelling with missing not at random data.  
arXiv preprint [arXiv:2006.12871 (2020).](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.12871)*  

Shows how to learn deep generative models with missing data under the MNAR assumption.   
The notebook `not-MIWAE-demo.ipynb` introduces the model and training step by step.  
`task01.py` runs the not-MIWAE and competitors on a UCI dataset.
